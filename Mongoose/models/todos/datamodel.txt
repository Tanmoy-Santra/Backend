User Model (user.model.js)
------------------------
Defines the schema for a user, including fields for name, email, and password.
Includes a reference to the Todo model to store the user's todos.

SubTodo Model (sub_todo.model.js)
--------------------------------
Defines the schema for a sub-todo, which includes a title and a completed status.

Todo Model (todo.model.js)
--------------------------
